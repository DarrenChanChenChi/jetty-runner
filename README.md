<br>
TODO:<br>
<b>1)</b> Debugger port selector; for now its fixed on 5007.<br>
<b>2)</b> Figure out why the debugger doesn't work out of the box; JetBrains?<br>
<b>3)</b> Better UI Layout- BoxLayout is not the greatest; GridBag?<br>
<b>4)</b> Unit Tests - sorry guys I got a bit lazy here.<br>
<b>5)</b> Bug fixes (?)<br>
<br>
Thanks for dropping by.
