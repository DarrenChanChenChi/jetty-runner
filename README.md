jetty-runner
============

A plugin that allows you to quickly run Jetty from IntelliJ IDEA CE.
This plugin should be Win / Mac / Linux compatible - target JDK5.

0.0.1 - First release; Runs Jetty 8.1.
Note: Debugging is available through 'Remote', on port 5007.

TODO:
1) Debugger port selector; for now its fixed on 5007.
2) Figure out why the debugger doesn't work out of the box; JetBrains?
3) Better UI Layout- BoxLayout is not the greatest; GridBag?
4) Unit Tests - sorry guys I got a bit lazy here.
5) Bug fixes (?)
